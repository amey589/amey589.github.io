Summary: About me

Hello There! This is my little corner on the web!
I stay in in beautiful city of Boston with my wife. I am software engineer, working at Simplivity HPE.I went to Northeastern University for my graduate studies.

I am fitness enthusiast and I recently discovered that I like running. I trained and finished half marathon and want to run full marathon, someday !!. I like to cook and try healthy, simple recipes, mostly Indian food.

One of the best thing I have discovered after coming to Boston is  public library network. Its free !!. One of my favourite pastime is going to public library and picking up non-fiction book. Many times I take books from sections that I know nothing about , its amazing to see books about every little aspect of life ! Checkout my reading history by cliking "books" under social links section.
