Summary: About me

Hello There! This is my little corner on the web where I plan to write about technology, fitness, food and books.

I stay in beautiful city of Boston with my wife. I am software engineer, working at Simplivity HPE.My mantra is try to learn new things everyday. Python, perl are my go-to languages and familiar with backend technologies.What I bring to the table at my work is designing software solutions to various platform features and bugs , contribute in agile development, fearless attitude towards solving problems and most importantly team player attitude. 

I am fitness enthusiast and I recently discovered that I like running. I trained and finished half marathon and want to run full marathon, someday !!. I like to cook and try healthy, simple recipes, mostly Indian food.

One of the best thing I have discovered after coming to Boston is public library network. Its free !!. One of my favorite pastime is going to public library and picking up non-fiction book. Many times I take books from sections that I know nothing about , its amazing to see books about every little aspect of life ! Checkout my reading list by clicking "Books" under social links section.
